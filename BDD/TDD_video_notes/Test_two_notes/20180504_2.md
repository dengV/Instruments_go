## Performance Testing


From Apple’s documentation: A performance test takes a block of code that you want to evaluate and runs it ten times, collecting the average execution time and the standard deviation for the runs. The averaging of these individual measurements form a value for the test run that can then be compared against a baseline to evaluate success or failure.


It’s very simple to write a performance test: you just put the code you want to measure into the closure of the measure() method.

Run the test, then click the icon that appears next to the end of the measure() closure to see the statistics.

Click Set Baseline, then run the performance test again and view the result — it might be better or worse than the baseline. The Edit button lets you reset the baseline to this new result.

Baselines are stored per device configuration, so you can have the same test executing on several different devices, and have each maintain a different baseline dependent upon the specific configuration’s processor speed, memory, etc.

Anytime you make changes to an app that might impact the performance of the method being tested, run the performance test again to see how it compares to the baseline.
