```
func asyncAdd(_ input: (Int, Int), runQueue: DispatchQueue, completionQueue: DispatchQueue, completion: @escaping (Int, Error?) -> ()){

    runQueue.async {
        let result = self.slowAdd(input)
        var error: Error?
        error = .none
        // Initialize error in the run queue closure.
        completionQueue.async {
            completion(result, error)
        }
    }
    // Asynchronous functions should always allow for errors,
    // so add an optional error argument to the completion handler



}

```




This run queue closure is an example of a chain of synchronous tasks where the output of each task,
is the input for the next task.

What if you have a group of similar but independent non-UI tasks?




### SDWebImage

举例，

Transforming an array of images,

The tasks are similar , so they use the same QoS, quality of service level,
but each task works on a different image so the tasks are independent in terms of their resource access datas,
and can run concurrently.
