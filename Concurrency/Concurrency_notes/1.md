# What is concurrency?
# 1

concurrency is more than one task running at the same time.
并发 ，就是同一时间点， 多任务 运行。



<hr>

不好搞啊


Communication problems can happen.



<hr>


Fortunately, these problems are easier to handle or avoid.

When you use GCD  and Operations.

<hr>


By the way , on a device with only one CPU,


at the same time means the operating system

对于 单核 的 CPU , 并发 意味着

## is context-switching among multiple tasks.

不同的任务间， 上下文 切换。

### 上下文




<hr>

But iPads and iPhones
have been dual-core since 2011.




<hr>

* dual-core , 双核

* dual， 双的

## Why use concurrency?
# 2


Second, why does your app need concurrency?




To keep the user interface responsive.


用并发， 可以让 UI 流畅。
<hr>


经典的例子:

A common problem
that concurrency solves
is a TableView of images that just will not scroll properly.

图片 列表， 又要 滑动， 又要 下载图片。


while the app is downloading and transforming the images.


<hr>

These are slow none-UI tasks
that should run somewhere else.

又缓慢， 与 UI 不相关 的 任务，

最好 在 别的地方跑，
不要放在 主线程。



### and that means concurrency.
