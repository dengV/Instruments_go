`var mapTable = NSMapTable<AnyObject, NSMutableArray>.weakToStrongObjects()`




//  use NSMapTable , to hold onto the object to closure mappings.
//  An NSMapTable is similar to a plain vanilla swift dictionary.
//  Both have keys and values.
//  Unlike a dictionary, an NSTable has a constructor for weakToStrongObjects()
//  A swift dictionary always strongly references its keys
//  by using the weakToStrongObjects() , this tells mapTable to weakly reference its keys


//  Now since these keys are actually going to be
//  delegate objects,
//  放的 键是， 代理对象

//  we would prefer them to be weakly referenced.
//  If they are not, we would have to remember to remove or unregister them,
//  which is easy to forget, and therefore, error prone.

//  Since they are weakly referenced by a mapTable.
//  they will automatically get removed.
//  if a delegate ever becomes nil.

//  the one downside is that NSMapTable
//  requires both keys and values to be objects.
//  So you must also use an NSMutableArray, instead of a swift array.

`public struct Array<Element> {`
