## Faking Objects and Interactions


Asynchronous tests give you confidence that your code generates correct input to an asynchronous API. You might also want to test that your code works correctly when it receives input from a URLSession, or that it correctly updates UserDefaults or a CloudKit database.



Most apps interact with system or library objects — objects you don’t control — and tests that interact with these objects can be slow and unrepeatable, violating two of the FIRST principles. Instead, you can fake the interactions by getting input from stubs or by updating mock objects.



Employ fakery when your code has a dependency on a system or library object — create a fake object to play that part and inject this fake into your code. Dependency Injection by Jon Reid describes several ways to do this.
