## UI Testing in Xcode


> Xcode 7 introduced UI testing, which lets you create a UI test by recording interactions with the UI. UI testing works by finding an app’s UI objects with queries, synthesizing events, then sending them to those objects. The API enables you to examine a UI object’s properties and state in order to compare them against the expected state.
