## iOS Unit and UI Testing


# XCTest

#### Tests prove your code works as intended.


> For example, if you have a gigantic class, that does everything and anything within your app,
It is going to be difficult to write tests for it.
Will also likely be difficult to make changes to this sort of code base.





### Single responsibility.
Each class should just focus on one thing.



### Tests also encourage loosely coupled classes ,
The easier it is to swap out of dependency,
the easier it is going to be to test,
or even move away from that dependency in your code.



* Unit tests are intended to test small units of code .
You'll frequently have tests that call a single method , with a given input and expect a certain result.
指定 函数 的输入，输出。
控制台 check




* UI tests are meant for testing the user interface.
These tests simulate how a user would interact with the app.
This includes pressing buttons,
scrolling , and so forth.

and expecting a certain result to appear on screen.
