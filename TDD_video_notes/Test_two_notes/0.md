## Using XCTestExpectation to Test Asynchronous Operations

Now that you’ve learned how to test models and debug test failures, let’s move on to using XCTestExpectation to test network operations.

URLSession methods are asynchronous: they return right away, but don’t really finish running until some time later. To test asynchronous methods, you use XCTestExpectation to make your test wait for the asynchronous operation to complete.

Asynchronous tests are usually slow, so you should keep them separate from your faster unit tests.
