# Priority inversion



You can assign different priorities to threads.


### Priority inversion is when a low-priority task preempts a higher-priority task.

### 不需要 资源的 中等 优先级 任务先走
### 高优先级 任务， 必须等 低优先级任务 KO. 因为 两者 需要 资源， 资源被 低优先级 任务 锁住了。

讲解 很精彩， 有配图

优先级 倒置 问题，

GCD and Operations solve it
by promoting the lower-priority tasks to the same level as the high-priority task.
The high-priority task does not jump the queue,
but the lower-priority tasks finish sooner.
and so they do not slow it down as much.
这他妈 的 什么意思。

# Deadlock
死锁 来了



This is where two threads are each waiting for the other to release a shared resource,

or to do something necessary for continuing.

<hr>


### 举个例子：
 Thread 1 requests and acquires a lock on resource 1.
 可以的
 
 Thread 2 requests and acquires a lock on resource 2.
 可以的
 
Thread 1 requests a lock on resource 2.
Can not acquire it, so it sleeps.

## 也 没什么问题



> Thread 2 will finish and release its lock on resource 2,
> and then thread 1 will acquire a lock.
线程 2 将要 完成 任务后， 把 对 资源 2 的 锁， 释放。
然后 线程 1 获取了 对 资源 2的 权限， 设置锁
> and execution will continue.


### But  then , thread 2 needs resource 1,
which is locked by thread 1, which is asleep,
Thead 2 can not get a lock on resource 1, so it also sleeps.
### 这下 GG 了。

<hr>

## Thread 1 is waiting for thread 2 to release resource 2.
Thread 2 is waiting for thread 1 to release resource 1.


and both threads are sleeping.
Neither of these threads will ever be able to continue.

<hr>


### 感觉是 线程 ， 资源 ， 与 线程对资源的  锁 ， 相互 干扰， GG

<hr>





锁机制， 可以 解决 资源 竞争 问题，

The locks are a solution for the race-condition problem,
which can also be solved with serial queues, and that will fix this deadlock scenario , too.

Operations , hight-level abstraction.


GCD , manual level.
