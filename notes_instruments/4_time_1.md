### The first thing to nitice is the Weight column over here.

Weight 栏：
This is how much of the work is being done.
In a particular sub tree.

## Self Weight 栏

and then we have the Self Weight column.

So the Self Weight column, is how much work is happening directly in that method , not in methods called
by that method, so the Self Weight column,
this is gonna be what you will use to find
### where the work is really happening.

You will do a smart disclosure, it will come down,

and you will have the CFRunLoopRun.


And basically the RunLoop is the thing
that is reacting to user events.
and drawing things to the screen.

that means cocoa,                                   // clever


### We have the gear, which is System Calls
like OS System calls.



* We have the person, which is our app itself.


### And the briefcase always seems to be GraphicsServices.
