Core Data 的 属性，

Core Data requires that you choose a type,


If you were planning to save data to that attribute,



<hr>



Underfined attributes must be marked as 
## transient.
( 暂时的 )




<hr>



An undefined transient , simply is an NSObject.

Core Data 提供了 很多，

that it comes with a lot of primitive data types.

初等数据类型


<hr>






<hr>


The binary data is simply `Data`, ( an NSData )


<hr>


If you have a type that converts to an NSData,

you select the type
 `Data`
to save directly to CoreData.






<hr>






<hr>


A transformable is a type that converts to,

an NSObject ,


class, 类 和 对象
=


and then is saved as `Data`, ( an NSData )


<hr>


A `transformable` saves the step of serializing and deserializing,
省略了序列化， 和解序列化

but you still have to perform `a cast operation`, to access the object.

    the UIColor actually implements 

    the NSCoding protocol,


    that is why we are able to set this as a transformable.
    
    

<hr>



Essentially ,

when we set a UIColor,

then when we go to save it,

that is converted to  `Data`, ( an NSData ) for us. 
and saved to disk,
保存到 CoreData, 也是保存到 硬盘。
and then when we try to access that, 


然后 we read it back, it is converted back from  `Data`, ( an NSData )  
to a UIColor.
就没必要做任何的 transformation.
