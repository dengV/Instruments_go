Core Data,

    The need for persisting data.


<hr>



Apple positions Core Data,

    as an object graph management system.
    
    
    
<hr>



<hr>

    举个例子 
    
In an address book application,


each contact may be represented by an object.
例子中， 每一个联系人， 都有相关信息。


<hr>

Going futher,

    each context may encupsulate other additional objects.
    
    
<hr>


your data, unless it was persisted,


would be lost when you exit your app.
