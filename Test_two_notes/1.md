This creates an SUT (System Under Test) object at the class level, so all the tests in this test class can access the SUT object’s properties and methods.

> Note: It’s good practice to create the SUT in setup() and release it in tearDown(), to ensure every test starts with a clean slate. For more discussion, check out Jon Reid’s post on the subject.

To modify your test so the asynchronous operation fails, simply delete the ‘s’ from “itunes” in the URL:




```
 let url = URL(string: "https://itune.apple.com/search?media=music&entity=song&term=abba")
```



Run the test: it fails, but it takes the full timeout interval! This is because its expectation is that the request succeeded, and that’s where you called promise.fulfill(). Since the request fails, the test finishes only when the timeout expires.




You can make this test fail faster by changing its expectation: instead of waiting for the request to succeed, wait only until the asynchronous method’s completion handler is invoked. This happens as soon as the app receives a response — either OK or error — from the server, which fulfills the expectation. Your test can then check whether the request succeeded.
