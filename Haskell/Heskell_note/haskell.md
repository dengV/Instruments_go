Minimal installers
What they are
Minimal installers provide centrally the GHC compiler and the Cabal and Stack tools for installing packages. Some may install further build tools (i.e. for parsing and lexing) as well.

What you get
Only the core libraries necessary for each platform are included.
Cabal or Stack must be used to download and install packages after installation.
How to get them
Linux
OS X (via the minimal platform)
Windows (via the minimal platform)
